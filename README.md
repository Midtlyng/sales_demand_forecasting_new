## Acknowledgements

This project was developed as a personal learning exercise. An AI assistant (Google's Gemini) was used as a tutor, particularly in developing a clear and effective communication style for the analytical narrative suitable for a non-technical audience. The collaboration also included guidance on code formatting and structuring the project workflow according to industry best practices. The core logic, analysis, and interpretation of the results are my own.
